### Future Improvements

* **Enhanced User Profiling:** The current model recommends items based on recent likes and dislikes[cite: 7, 213]. A future version could build a more detailed and long-term user style profile. [cite_start]This would involve tracking preferences over time for features like color, fit, occasion, and brand to provide more deeply personalized recommendations[cite: 262].

* **Scalability and Performance:** The current implementation uses a local ChromaDB for development[cite: 32]. [cite_start]To handle thousands of requests as per the "depth of implementation" goal[cite: 269], the backend could be migrated to a cloud-based vector database. [cite_start]Additionally, implementing more robust caching strategies beyond the simple index search cache [cite: 52] would improve performance.

* **Interactive Style Quiz:** The app could incorporate the interactive style quiz mentioned in the original problem statement[cite: 250, 259]. [cite_start]Instead of just liking/disliking items on the "Discover" screen [cite: 166][cite_start], users could be presented with a set of 20 images initially to establish a baseline preference model[cite: 260, 261].

* **"Shop the Look" Feature:** Drawing inspiration from the initial problem brief of showing actors in different outfits[cite: 260], a "Shop the Look" feature could be added. When a user likes a particular outfit on a model, the app could identify and recommend individual items (e.g., the shirt, pants, shoes) from its inventory that match the style.

* **Diversifying Product Categories:** The app currently focuses on garments[cite: 178, 237]. [cite_start]It could be expanded to include other fashion categories like jewelry, cosmetics, and accessories, as suggested in the initial FAQs[cite: 255]. This would require expanding the dataset and potentially refining the recommendation model to handle different product types.

* **Advanced Recommendation Explanations:** The app already explains *why* a product is recommended[cite: 106, 212, 264]. This could be enhanced by providing more detailed insights, such as, "We're showing you this because you liked maroon hoodies and also tend to prefer products with a user rating above 4 stars."
