### Future Improvements

* **Enhanced User Profiling:** The current model recommends items based on recent likes and dislikes. A future version could build a more detailed and long-term user style profile. This would involve tracking preferences over time for features like color, fit, occasion, and brand to provide more deeply personalized recommendations.

* **Scalability and Performance:** The current implementation uses a local ChromaDB for development. To handle thousands of requests as per the "depth of implementation" goal, the backend could be migrated to a cloud-based vector database. Additionally, implementing more robust caching strategies beyond the simple index search cache  would improve performance.

* **Interactive Style Quiz:** The app could incorporate the interactive style quiz mentioned in the original problem statement. Instead of just liking/disliking items on the "Discover" screen , users could be presented with a set of 20 images initially to establish a baseline preference model.

* **"Shop the Look" Feature:** Drawing inspiration from the initial problem brief of showing actors in different outfits, a "Shop the Look" feature could be added. When a user likes a particular outfit on a model, the app could identify and recommend individual items (e.g., the shirt, pants, shoes) from its inventory that match the style.

* **Diversifying Product Categories:** The app currently focuses on garments. It could be expanded to include other fashion categories like jewelry, cosmetics, and accessories, as suggested in the initial FAQs. This would require expanding the dataset and potentially refining the recommendation model to handle different product types.

* **Advanced Recommendation Explanations:** The app already explains *why* a product is recommended. This could be enhanced by providing more detailed insights, such as, "We're showing you this because you liked maroon hoodies and also tend to prefer products with a user rating above 4 stars."
